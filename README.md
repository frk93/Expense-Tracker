#Expense Tracker - React

**This is a sample practise expense tracker application created in React. 
I used React Context API and react Hooks to give the app ability of using global state.**

*I also create CI/CD for this project so every push to master make a new deployment on the below URL.*

App is Hosted on the following URL:
